Problem: 

You are given a description of a rooted tree. Your task is to compute and output its height. Recall that the height of a (rooted) tree is the maximum depth of a node, or the maximum distance from a leaf to the root. You are given an arbitrary tree, not necessarily a binary tree.

Input Format: 

The first line contains the number of vertices 𝑛. The second line contains 𝑛 integer numbers from −1 to 𝑛 − 1 — parents of vertices. If the 𝑖-th one of them (0 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛 − 1) is −1, vertex 𝑖 is the root, otherwise it’s 0-based index of the parent of 𝑖-th vertex. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one root. It is guaranteed that the input represents a tree.
