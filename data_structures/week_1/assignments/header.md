Week 1, Problem 2: Compute Tree Height

Constraints: N is greater than 1 and less than 10^5.

Input: first line is number of vertices, N. second line contains n ints from -1 to 1 where each int is a parent of a vertex. 
If Ni is -1, Ni is the root. Otherwise, it's the index of the root. 

Output: The height of the tree.

4 -1 4 1 1

Read this as VALUE has a child INDEX.
